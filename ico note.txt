NB 
1.Geocites doesn't allow .ico files to be uploaded.
Can get around this by changing the .ico file extension to .zip, uploading it, and then renaming the .zip-> to.ico in Geocities File Manager.

2. To make the .ico files, I used a program called PhotoFiltre 6.0.2 (software 7).
Open up a photo in it, and then from the Menu Bar>Tools>Export as icon.
